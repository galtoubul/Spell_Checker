# Spell Checker

This program was written as part of a data structures course by David kipnis and Gal Toubul

## Mission

Finding misspellings at a given text.

## Data Structures

1. Hash table <br />
2. Red Black Tree <br />

The hash table will contain the supplied dictionary. <br />
The red black tree will contain the given text. 

## Stages of execution

1. Reading the dictionary's word and inserting them into the hash table. <br />
2. Sorting the words in the hash table using base sort. <br />
3. Reading the input file and inserting its words into the red black tree. <br />
4. Deleting every word at the red black tree which occurs at the dictionary (hash table). <br />
5. Printing the word that were left at the red black tree and giving a suggestion for fixing the misspellings.

## Complexity

n is the number of words in the dictionary and m is the number of words in the given text

Time: O(log(max(n, m))) <br />
                   <t>     Hash Table:<br />
                   <t>     inserting is done at O(1)<br />
                    <t>    searching in the hash table with a×ž even distribution is done at amortized time O(1)<br />
                    <t>    and O(log(n)) at WC since we can use binary search <br />
                    <t>    base sort is done at O(n)<br />
                  <t>      RBT: all actions are done at O(log(m)) at WC   <br />                                             
Space: O(n + m) for storing the dictionary and the given text
